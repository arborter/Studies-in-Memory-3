// This little program studies the values of an array with non-specified values and the values of addresses in memory not filled by anything.
//
//      The studies are as follows:
//  0. Creates new memory to be used by malloc()
//  1. Prints the non-designated value per index numeration. This means that and there is a portion of memory in this array composed of 'garbage' values, i.e. non-specified values per index numeration.
//  2. Prints the address of this non-designated value per index numeration, including null value.
//  3. Prints the address per byte of memory created by malloc().
//  4. Frees the memory created by malloc() at the end of the loop because we are, then, done with our study.
